## Description

My week learning of the 17th September is building and configuring a Phoenix
app with Umbrella for releasing with Docker.

This repo goes through the process of building Elixir and Phoenix apps within an Umbrella project, releasing it with Distillery and containerizing it with Docker, ready for deploying in production.

Umbrella projects are a way to break apart different parts of a project into
smaller isolated applications


## TODOs

- [x] Amend README as you go
- [x] Create a new elixir app
- [x] Add Phoenix
- [x] Add Basic Auth
- [ ] Add a 'Greeter app' as a dependency for the Phoenix app
- [ ] Create a channel for the JS to interact with our Greeter app
- [ ] Use distillery!
- [ ] Add docker

## ScreenShots
